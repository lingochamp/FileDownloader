# downloading tasks unlimited simultaneously, it will be blocked by lack of the network resource,
# and more useless CPU occupy.

# This option is very useful when you download something silent on the background on the filedownloader

# are completed downloading on the filedownloader process, so you can set this one to `true`, then
# when a task is completed task, you will receive the broadcast, and the main process will be relaunched
# to handle the broadcast.
#
# If you want to receive such broadcast, you also need to register receiver with

# You can use FileDownloadBroadcastHandler class to parse the received intent.
